## Test build the site locally

You need Node (at least v8+) on your computer. To check if you have node and
what version run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
```

Clone this repo, fire up your terminal, go to the new folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies.

**Build it for dev** To build your static website for local development run:

```bash
npm run build-dev
```

This will build the static website into the `/dev` folder without all the
minifiying and purging stuff (<- much faster and a more human friendly code
output, but a much bigger package)

**Run in dev mode** To run the build-dev task automatically on file changes
run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

That will run a local server from `/dev` folder and connects browser sync to
it. On changes within the `/src` folder it will run the `npm run build-dev`
command automatically and will refresh your browser.

**Build it for production** To build site for a prod deployment run:

```bash
npm run build
```

That will output the full site, with purged and minified CSS and minified html.
The output will be stored in the `/public` folder. This is done automatically
from main in GitHub Actions, and hosted by GitHub Pages.

Site developed from the <a href="https://11straps.com"
target="_blank">11straps.com</a> template. It combines the static site
generator <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">11ty</a> with the CSS
framework <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 5</a>
and is stitched together with some npm and Gulp magic dust. It minifies and
purges the CSS file (so it removes any unused CSS) and comes with a static
server and browser sync support for your local development.
