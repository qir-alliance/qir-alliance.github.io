The QIR Alliance is a joint effort to develop a forward-looking quantum intermediate representation with the goal to enable full interoperability within the quantum ecosystem and reduce development effort from all parties.

We strive to develop a holistic solution that permits to take full advantage of unique and distinct capabilities in the landscape of heterogenous quantum processors. We are thrilled to be collaborating closely with the quantum community to design and implement the necessary compiler technology to accelerate advances in quantum programming language design and execution systems.
