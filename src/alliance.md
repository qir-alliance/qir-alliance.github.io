The QIR Alliance is a joint effort to develop a forward-looking quantum intermediate representation with the goal to enable full interoperability within the quantum ecosystem and reduce development effort from all parties.

We strive to develop a holistic solution that permits to take full advantage of unique and distinct capabilities in the landscape of heterogenous quantum processors. We are thrilled to be collaborating closely with the quantum community to design and implement the necessary compiler technology to accelerate advances in quantum programming language design and execution systems.

## Meetings

The steering committee meets once a month. The meetings are not open to the public at this time, but minutes are published [here](https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/tree/main/minutes). The steering committee may invite domain experts and repository maintainers to join the discussions. Please reach out to [qiralliance@mail.com](mailto:qiralliance@mail.com) if you would like to propose a topic for consideration and/or would like to volunteer your time and expertise.

## Community

We are excited to be collaborating closely with the quantum community to design and implement the necessary infrastructure and specs to accelerate advances in quantum technologies.
We are always looking for community members to help us shape the future of this technology.
We want to recognize the following individuals from the community who have significant impact on the QIR Alliance's mission:

- [Sarah Kaiser](https://github.com/crazy4pi314), QIR Alliance Core Maintainer

If you are interested in joining the QIR Alliance, or contributing to areas that are not code, please reach out to [qiralliance@mail.com](mailto:qiralliance@mail.com) and we will be happy to discuss how you can help.
