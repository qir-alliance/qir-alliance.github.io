The workshop is hosted at [IEEE Quantum Week 2022](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2022) at the International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE).

The virtual workshop will be held online on Thursday, Sept. 22 10:00-16:45 Mountain Time (MDT) — UTC-6.
If you would like the participate, please [register for the conference](https://web.cvent.com/event/41315fca-fab0-4847-8bcd-ca0e07d2c849/summary).

The goal of this workshop is to provide a platform for discussing current state-of-the-art approaches to quantum intermediate representation development, expression, deployment, and utility. This workshop will highlight recent approaches, future directions, and novel designs through a series of invited presentations on specific challenge topics from leaders in the field of quantum compilation and software. It is our hope that this workshop will spur collaboration and introduce the community to novel languages, compilers, and frameworks enabling a cohesive and unified software toolchain for quantum-classical computation.

The full abstract of the workshop can also be found on [IEEE Quantum Week’s website](https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2022/workshops-program/#alexandermccaskey).

## Program

### Introduction and Welcome

*10:00am - 10:30am Mountain Time* <br/>
Presentation (Bettina Heim): A Holistic View of the Quantum-Classical Software Stack

### Session 1: Cross Platform Programming Approaches

*10:30am - 12:00pm Mountain Time* <br/>
The focus of this session is on programming model approaches and frameworks that enable one to program quantum architectures in a cross-platform manner, and their integration with classically heterogeneous system architectures.

Presentation 1 (Blake Johnson): TBD
Presentation 2 (Andrea Mari): TBD
Panel Discussion: Alec Edgington, Michal Stechly, Steve Reinhardt <br/>

### Session 2: Code Transformations and Analysis

*12:30pm - 2:00pm Mountain Time* <br/>
The focus of this session is on lowering high-level abstractions to a common intermediate representation, integration across different toolchains, as well as transformations and analysis passes associated with subsequent compilation stages.

Presentation 1 (Pete Campora): TBD
Presentation 2 (Troels Ronnow): TBD
Panel Discussion: Tom Lubinski, John Dumbell, Thien Nguyen <br/>

### Session 3: Interfacing with Physical Architectures

*2:30pm - 4:00pm Mountain Time* <br/>
The focus of this session is on targeting a common intermediate representation depending on backend properties, and interfacing the intermediate representation with control electronics systems driving quantum dynamics on the physical architecture.

Presentation 1 (Thomas Alexander): TBD
Presentation 2 (Kalan Snyder): TBD
Panel Discussion: Wim Lavrijsen, Alan Geller <br/>

### Open Discussion and Networking

*4:00pm - 4:45pm Mountain Time* <br/>
Open discussion and brainstorming to identify collaboration opportunities
