refer to the corresponding workstream definition for more information about how
to get involved. Alternatively, please reach out to
[qiralliance@mail.com](mailto:qiralliance@mail.com).

The following workstreams have been approved by the steering committee and are
currently actively worked on:

- Specification of a Base Profile that defines the minimal requirements to
  define and execute quantum programs [workstream
  definition](https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/blob/main/workstreams/Base_Profile_Workstream.md),
  [GitHub issue](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qir-spec/issues/7)

If you would like to suggest a new workstream, please take a look at the
[workstream creation
template](https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/blob/main/workstreams/Workstream_Creation_Template.md),
and reach out to [qiralliance@mail.com](mailto:qiralliance@mail.com) with your
suggestion. Currently, creation of the following workstreams are being
discussed:

- Update the QIR specification to clarify mechanisms for entry point handling,
  including command line input as well as runtime initialization and
  finalization [GitHub
