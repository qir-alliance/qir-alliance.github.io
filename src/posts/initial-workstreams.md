Information about ongoing workstreams under the QIR Alliance and their organization, purpose, and meeting cadence can be found [here](https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/blob/main/workstreams/). We refer to the corresponding workstream definition for more information about how to get involved. Alternatively, please reach out to [qiralliance@mail.com](mailto:qiralliance@mail.com).

The following workstreams have been approved by the steering committee and are currently actively worked on:

- Specification of a Base Profile that defines the minimal requirements to define and execute quantum programs [workstream definition](https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/blob/main/workstreams/Base_Profile_Workstream.md), [GitHub issue](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qir-spec/issues/7)

If you would like to suggest a new workstream, please take a look at the [workstream creation template](https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/blob/main/workstreams/Workstream_Creation_Template.md), and reach out to [qiralliance@mail.com](mailto:qiralliance@mail.com) with your suggestion. Currently, creation of the following workstreams are being discussed:

- Update the QIR specification to clarify mechanisms for entry point handling, including command line input as well as runtime initialization and finalization [GitHub issue](https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/issues/16)
