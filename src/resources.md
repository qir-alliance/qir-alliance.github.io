## Inquiries and Community Forums

For any inquiries about the QIR Alliance, our work and upcoming opportunities, please contact [qiralliance@mail.com](mailto:qiralliance@mail.com).
If you are curious about our work, we encourage you to join our Open Source community on Discord. The QIR community meets on the [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund/) Discord server; to add the server, please follow this [invite](https://discord.com/invite/JqVGmpkP96) before clicking on the links below. The following forums and events may be of interest for you:

- [QIR channel](https://discord.com/channels/764231928676089909/920935966586306631) on the Unitary Fund Discord
- [QIR Alliance community call](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?eid=NnJua2o0M2hqOGQyODZrdHAxYW82djg2Z2RfMjAyMjAyMDNUMTczMDAwWiBjX21ncWRxNmhqMmlzaTRkNmg0NjdrZnF2ZzYwQGc) every other week on Thursdays

## Contributing

Whether you are curious about our work or already deeply engaged, the following
**existing repositories** may be interesting to you:

- [**qir-spec**](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qir-spec): QIR specification defining how to represent quantum programs within the LLVM IR
- [**pyqir**](https://github.com/qir-alliance/pyqir) [[examples](https://github.com/qir-alliance/pyqir/tree/main/examples)]: Python bindings for emitting, loading, and executing QIR.
- [**qat**](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qat) [[docs](https://qir-alliance.github.io/qat/)]: QIR compiler tools and optimization passes for targeting QIR to different hardware backends
- [**qcor**](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qcor) [[examples](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qcor/tree/master/examples), [docs](https://aide-qc.github.io/deploy/lang_spec/)]: C++ compiler for heterogeneous quantum-classical computing using QIR, including the XACC runtime

We refer to the guidelines in the respective repository for contributions to existing repositories. Please also take a look at [community forums](#inquiries-and-community-forums) to learn more about QIR related projects and discussions.

We welcome **new repositories** under the QIR Alliance from both members and non-members of the organization. If you feel your repository would fit in well under this org, please reach out to [qiralliance@mail.com](mailto:qiralliance@mail.com). The steering committee will will approve and initiate the creation of new repositories, and facilitate the <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->[migration](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository#transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-user-account)<!-- markdown-link-check-enable --> of existing ones.

We largely leave it up to the repository maintainers to define the rules and guidelines for their repositories, including legal matters such as a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement). The only requirements for code repositories under the QIR Alliance are the following:

- At least two maintainers need to be designated for the repository, and a way to contact the maintainers should be shared with the steering committee.
- The repository is either actively maintained by the maintainers or the repository is <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->[archived](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories)<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->.
- The Code of Conduct aligns in spirit with the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/blob/main/Code_of_Conduct.md) of the broader org.
- The project should be related in content to the goals and scope of the QIR Alliance as outlined on the [org page](https://qiralliance.org/).
- All code should be licensed under [MIT license](https://mit-license.org/), and we highly recommend to ask new contributors to accept the CLA defined by the maintainers. Instructions for how to set up a basic bot that present the chosen CLA to new contributors and asks them to accept it can be found [here](https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/blob/main/workflow-templates/utils/cla_bot_setup.md).

The QIR Alliance will reach out to the maintainers if a repository no longer satisfies these criteria to reach an agreement and resolve the situation. If the maintainers cannot be reached or are unable to take action, the QIR Alliance reserves the right to <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->[archive the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories)<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->.
