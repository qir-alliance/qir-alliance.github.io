## Contributing

Whether you are curious about our work or already deeply engaged, the following
**existing repositories** may be interesting to you:

- [**qir-spec**](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qir-spec): QIR specification
  defining how to represent quantum programs within the LLVM IR
- [**pyqir**](https://github.com/qir-alliance/pyqir)
  [[examples](https://github.com/qir-alliance/pyqir/tree/main/examples)]: Python
  bindings for emitting, loading, and executing QIR.
- [**qcor**](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qcor)
  [[examples](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qcor/tree/master/examples),
  [docs](https://aide-qc.github.io/deploy/lang_spec/)]: C++ compiler for
  heterogeneous quantum-classical computing using QIR, including the XACC
  runtime
- [**qat**](https://github.com/qir-alliance/qat)
  [[docs](https://qir-alliance.github.io/qat/)]: QIR compiler tools and
  optimization passes for targeting QIR to different hardware backends

We refer to the guidelines in the respective repository for contributions to
existing repositories. Please also take a look at [community
forums](#inquiries-and-community-forums) to learn more about QIR related
projects and discussions.

We welcome **new repositories** under the QIR Alliance from both members and
non-members of the organization. If you feel your repository would fit in well
under this org, please reach out to
[qiralliance@mail.com](mailto:qiralliance@mail.com). The steering committee will
will approve and initiate the creation of new repositories, and facilitate the
[migration](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository#transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-user-account)
of existing ones.

We largely leave it up to the repository maintainers to define the rules and
guidelines for their repositories, including legal matters such as a
[Contributor License Agreement
(CLA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement). The only
requirements for code repositories under the QIR Alliance are the following:

- At least two maintainers need to be designated for the repository, and a way
  to contact the maintainers should be shared with the steering committee.
- The repository is either actively maintained by the maintainers or the
  repository is archived.
- The Code of Conduct aligns in spirit with the [Code of
  Conduct](https://github.com/qir-alliance/.github/blob/main/Code_of_Conduct.md)
  of the broader org.
- The project should be related in content to the goals and scope of the QIR
  Alliance as outlined above.
- All code should be licensed under [MIT license](https://mit-license.org/), and
  contributors to the repository must accept a CLA defined by the maintainers.

The QIR Alliance will reach out to the maintainers if a repository no longer
satisfies these criteria to reach an agreement and resolve the situation. If the
maintainers cannot be reached or are unable to take action, the QIR Alliance
reserves the right to [archive the
repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories).
